I'm a Second-year Bioengineering master's student from [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/), [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). My research interests include neuroimage (MRI) analysis, machine learning, brain connectivity and network, neurologic and psychiatric disorders.

Currently, I am very fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Hao Huang](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8837947) and [Dr. Minhui Ouyang](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8844108) of [Laboratory for Neural MRI and Brain Connectivity @ CHOP and Penn](https://www.med.upenn.edu/huanglab/).

You can find my latest CV here: [Wentao Wu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
